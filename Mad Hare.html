          <em>Mad Hare, Hollow Rabbit and an Idea of the Hyperloop</em> and <em>Mad Hare, Hollow Rabbit and the Wheel They Deserved</em> are two works featuring the same pair of ball-jointed figures, 3D printed and assembled by hand. The joints are articulated, the strings visible, the head of one figure hollow and open. This transparency of construction is also what makes them available for different situations — the same bodies repositioned, bound, or connected depending on what the next exhibition asks of them.<br><br>

          Borrowing the episodic logic of illustrated moral tales, the same characters are returned to across exhibitions, each time deeper in trouble. In the first work, the two face each other across a thin white tube, one appearing to draw something out of the hollow head of the other. In the second, they are bound to a spinning wheel of fortune, the hollow head striking the plinth on each rotation. The plinth was wrapped in found newspaper collected in the days before the show. The works were shown at <em>Cave Dwellers</em> with Ludvig Wilén at <em>Temple am Main</em> in December 2025 and at the Städelschule Rundgang I11 2026 respectively. <br> <br>

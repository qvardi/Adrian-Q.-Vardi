  <em>Mies or A Crippled Symmetry</em> is a 3D-animated 9 minute film set in a digital reconstruction of Ludwig Mies van der Roheâ€™s Barcelona Pavilion, originally built for the 1929 International Exposition and dismantled in 1930. The architecture was remodeled based on original blueprints.<br>
  The film follows a digitally aged version of Mies, whose presence is rendered through blurred reflections and fragmented views, alternating between first-person perspective and external shots from low angles, ceilings, and windows.<br>
  As he sits down, the building begins to collapse, and Mies falls into a bottomless pit. The camera enters his body, revealing an interior space composed of deformed fragments of the pavilion. Over time, these fragments slowly assemble into a new architectural structure.<br>
  Sound design was developed by Chengchen Pan, focusing on haptic, close-range realism.<br>
  <br>
  The film was shown in several screenings and exhibitons, including the DFF (Deutsches Filminstitut & Filmmuseum), the Vietnam Art Collection (VAC), Kunsthalle Kassel and the GfZK Unlearning Digitalities program.

          <em>My Little Prince Snow White</em> is a 3D printed scale model assembling a skyline of unrealized architectural proposals. Exhibited in <em>Cave Dwellers</em> with Ludvig Wilén at <em> Temple am Main </em>in December 2025, the work was positioned diagonally toward the gallery window, juxtaposing the speculative city with Frankfurt’s postmodern reality.<br> <br>



          Within the sculpture, ideological and authoritarian visions such as the Volkshalle coexist with modernist utopias like Le Corbusier’s Cité Radieuse, alongside fictional architectures from literature and film including <em>Metropolis</em> and <em>Laputa</em>.<br> <br> The model’s supports function as scaffolding, emphasizing the act of construction while also encircling the buildings like residues or latent ruins, traces of projects that were never built yet persist in collective imagination. Cast in plastic, the miniature skyline condenses multiple historical timelines into a single form, subtly echoing the layered architectural history visible beyond the window. <br> <br>
          Installed within an apartment building that forms part of a former social housing complex, the work extends this dialogue into the exhibition space itself, where lived urban reality frames the speculative city. <br><br>

  <em>Hello, my name isâ€¦</em>
  <span>is a 15 minute narrative short film about the daily routine of a virtual being working for an agency that promises to fulfill any wish.</span><br><br>
  <span>Throughout the story, the being encounters clients with very different desires: a manager who treats it as a product, a fashion designer who sees it as a muse, a lonely man searching for closeness, a transhumanist longing to become it, and finally its own exhausted creator.</span><br><br>
  <span>All roles are performed by me, tracing the shifting relations between the being and those who rely on it, until the being ultimately begins to produce itself.</span>

    The composer Dmitri Shostakovich has dealt with constant political pressure and illness throughout his life.
  As a cultural showpiece of the Soviet regime, he continuously balanced on a thin thread between life and death.<br><br>

  For the DSCH exhibition at Gewandhaus Leipzig, the composer was brought to the sales shelves of the concert house with the collectors toy “Shostagotchi”.<br>
  The owner of the Shostagotchi must take good care of the character in order for it to survive.<br><br>

  Throughout the exhibition, the avatar's various emotions and needs were characterized by changing animations and MIDI sound snippets.
